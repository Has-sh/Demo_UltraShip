# Employee Management Demo

This project is a demo for an **Employee Management System** built with **Spring Boot** and **GraphQL**. It showcases how to handle employee creation, secure credentials management, and provide authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

## Features:
- **Employee Creation**: Create employee profiles with details like name, age, class, subjects, and attendance.
- **Authentication**: User authentication using username and password with JWT token generation.
- **Credential Management**: Secure password storage using **bcrypt** hashing for employee login.
- **GraphQL**: The application uses GraphQL for querying and mutating data.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure access to protected resources via JWT tokens.
  
## Exposed Endpoints: Here are the instructions on how to set up, run, and test the application, as well as the features and API details.

## API Endpoints

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

This project enforces access control based on user roles, restricting specific actions and queries according to the userâ€™s assigned role. Below is a summary of the operations accessible to each role.

---

#### Roles and Access Levels

1. **Admin** (`ADMIN` Role):
   - **Full Access**: Admins have unrestricted access to all mutations, queries, and management operations, including employee creation, updates, and other administrative actions.
   - **Example Operations Available to Admin**:
     - `createEmployeeAndCredentials`
     - `updateEmployee`
     - `getEmployee`
     - `getAllEmployees`

2. **Employee** (`EMPLOYEE` Role):
   - **Restricted Access**: Employees can view their own data but are restricted from accessing or modifying other employees' information.
   - **Accessible Operations**:
     - `getEmployee` (limited to their own data based on `id` validation)
     - Specific queries based on their `employeeId` matching the authenticated user.

3. **Unauthenticated Access**:
   - **Limited to Specific Operations**: Only certain mutations or endpoints are accessible without authentication.
   - **Public Operations**:
     - `createEmployeeAndCredentials`: Allows creating a new employee and credentials without requiring existing authentication.
     - `login`: Allows a user to login and get the JWT token for further access to authenication based endpoints
     - **Note**: Other mutations and queries are restricted for unauthenticated users.

## Testing

To test the functionality of the Employee Management System, you can use the following test cases:

### Test Case 1: Create Employee and Credentials
- **Objective**: Verify that an employee can be created successfully.
- **Steps**:
  1. Send a `createEmployeeAndCredentials` mutation request with valid data.
  2. Verify that the employee is created successfully in the database.
  3. Check the response to confirm the employee's username is returned.

### Test Case 2: Login with Correct Credentials
- **Objective**: Verify that login works with valid credentials.
- **Steps**:
  1. Send a `login` mutation with correct credentials.
  2. Verify that a JWT token is returned in the response.

### Test Case 3: Login with Incorrect Password
- **Objective**: Verify that login fails with incorrect credentials.
- **Steps**:
  1. Send a `login` mutation with incorrect credentials.
  2. Verify that the response contains an authentication error message.

### Test Case 4: Unauthorized Access to Protected Endpoint
- **Objective**: Verify that unauthorized access is denied.
- **Steps**:
  1. Send a request to a protected endpoint without a valid JWT token.
  2. Ensure that the response returns an error indicating unauthorized access.

### Test Case 5: JWT Token Expiration
- **Objective**: Verify that an expired JWT token is rejected.
- **Steps**:
  1. Wait for the JWT token to expire.
  2. Send a request with the expired token.
  3. Ensure that the response contains an expiration error.

## Additional Information

- **Password Storage**: Passwords are stored securely in the database using **BCrypt** hashing.
- **JWT Token**: The JWT token is used for authentication, and it is returned after a successful login.
  
## Conclusion

This Employee Management System allows administrators and users to manage employee data securely with authentication and role-based access control. It leverages **Spring Boot** for backend development and **GraphQL** for flexible querying. The application uses **BCrypt** for secure password hashing and **JWT** for secure authentication.

For further improvements:
  - Normalize the database (creating separate table for subjects and attendence)
  - Creating refresh token
  - Security improvement against csrf and xss attacks
  - Some edge case handling
    
## Technologies Used:
- **Spring Boot**: Backend framework for building the application.
- **GraphQL**: API query language for handling data.
- **JWT**: For handling authentication and securing the API.
- **BCrypt**: For securely hashing and storing passwords.
- **H2 Database**: Lightweight in-memory database for storing employee data.
